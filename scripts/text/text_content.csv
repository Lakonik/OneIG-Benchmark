We present a residual learning framework to ease the training of networks that are substantially deeper than those used previously. We explicitly reformulate the layers as learning residual functions with reference to the layer inputs, instead of learning unreferenced functions. We provide comprehensive empirical evidence showing that these residual networks are easier to optimize, and can gain accuracy from considerably increased depth. On the ImageNet dataset we evaluate residual nets with a depth of up to 152 layers- $8 \times$ deeper than VGG nets [41] but still having lower complexity. An ensemble of these residual nets achieves $3.57 %$ error on the ImageNet test set. This result won the 1st place on the ILSVRC 2015 classification task. We also present analysis on CIFAR-10 with 100 and 1000 layers. The depth of representations is of central importance for many visual recognition tasks.

In this paper, we embrace this observation and introduce the Dense Convolutional Network, which connects each layer to every other layer in a feed-forward fashion. Whereas traditional convolutional networks with $L$ layers have $L$ connections-one between each layer and its subsequent layer-our network has $\frac{L(L+1)}{2}$ direct connections. For each layer, the feature-maps of all preceding layers are used as inputs, and its own feature-maps are used as inputs into all subsequent layers. DenseNets have several compelling advantages: they alleviate the vanishing-gradient problem, strengthen feature propagation, encourage feature reuse, and substantially reduce the number of parameters. We evaluate our proposed architecture on four highly competitive object recognition benchmark tasks. DenseNets obtain significant improvements over the state-of-the-art on most of them, whilst requiring less computation to achieve high performance.","['Title: Densely Connected Convolutional Networks\nAuthor List: Gao Huang, Zhuang Liu, Laurens van der Maaten, Kilian Q.
